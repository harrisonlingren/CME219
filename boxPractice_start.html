        <h1>This is a heading with 10px black border and a drop shadow with 4px displacement 8px blur and black shadow.</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph that has a top and bottom margin of 20px and padding of 20px on all sides.<br>
            <i>The border has the same properties as the h1, just use orange for the color.</i>
        </p>
        <h2>Check this out! I have 10px rounded corners with 15px top and bottom padding and 30px left and right padding.</h2>
        <div><p>And this div element has a width of 50% with a minimum width of 400px and am comfortably centered on the page.</p>
            <p> I also have a padding of 15px on all sides EXCEPT the bottom which has padding of 30px.</p>
            <p>And the circle below... well, it's only 100px wide. It also has a 5px border, center aligned text, 20px padding all around and drop shadow with
                NO displacement and a 20px spread. Cool, huh?</p></div>
