			<h2>
				What is HTML and CSS?
			</h2>
			
			<p id="html">
				<strong>HTML</strong> stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> and is the backbone of web content. 
				HTML formats text in a way that allows browsers to properly display your content. 
				By using this universal code, all browsers can read and display webpages from all 
				around the world.
			</p>
			
			<br />
			
			<p id="css">
				<strong>CSS</strong>, or <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em>, styles your html content. Through CSS, 
				you can choose specific fonts, colors, and locations for your content. 
				You can also add other stylistic elements such as background pictures, 
				buttons, and boxes with drop shadows to further style your content. CSS can 
				take a rather plain webpage and make it look more like a work of art.

			<h2>
				Why learn HTML and CSS?
			</h2>
			
			<p>
				Many believe using MYSIWYG editors are good enough; there is no reason to really 
				learn HTML or CSS. Although these editors do allow you to create a web page, they 
				often do not create valid code. These editors often go against industry best 
				practices and often make your site look amateurish.
			</p>
			
			<br />
			
			<p>
				In today's job market, especially in the media industry, you would be hard pressed 
				to find a job that did not come in contact with web development in some way. Even 
				if it is simply updating an email address or completely redesigning a website, knowing 
				HTML and CSS will allow you easily make these changes and become a valuable skill in 
				the job market.
			</p>
			
			<br />
			
			<h2>
				How do I get started?
			</h2>
			
			<p>
				Taking this course is a great first step. You will learn the basics of HTML, some of 
				the nuances of HTML5 and then learn to style your content like an expert using CSS. 
				If you want some extra help, make sure you visit the resources page.
