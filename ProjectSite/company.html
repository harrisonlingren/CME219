			<h1>Welcome to Tony's Pizzeria!</h1>
			
			<p>
				Tony’s Pizzeria was first established in 1905 in Indianapolis, Indiana. 
				Located in the Broadripple area close to Butler University, Tony’s Pizzeria 
				quickly became a popular hangout for college students and locals. 
				Due to its success among the college crowd, Tony’s soon opened locations in and 
				around the Indianapolis area.
				
				<br /><br />
				
				Even with several locations, Tony’s Pizzeria still remains family run. Tony’s family 
				immigrated from Italy and its these authentic Italian recipes that make their 
				pizzas one-of-a-kind. Using only fresh ingredients, Tony makes his own dough, sauce, and 
				homemade mozzarella daily.  Its no wonder Tony’s Pizzeria has been voted the Best 
				Pizza in Indy several times over!
